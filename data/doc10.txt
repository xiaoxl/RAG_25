Healthy sleep is essential for physical and mental well-being.
Adults typically need between seven and nine hours of sleep per night, though individual needs may vary.

Good sleep hygiene includes maintaining a consistent bedtime, avoiding screens before sleep, and limiting caffeine intake in the afternoon.
Creating a quiet and comfortable sleeping environment helps improve rest quality.

Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to mood disorders, weakened immune function, and impaired cognitive performance.
