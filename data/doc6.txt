Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. 
While natural variability has always existed, modern climate change is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.

Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases trap more heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming, melting ice sheets, and more frequent extreme weather events.
Mitigation strategies include reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and transitioning to renewable energy sources.
