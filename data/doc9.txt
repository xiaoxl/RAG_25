The Roman Empire began in 27 BCE when Augustus became the first emperor.
At its height, it controlled vast territories across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

Roman engineering achievements included roads, aqueducts, and monumental architecture such as the Colosseum.
The empire eventually split into Eastern and Western parts, with the Western Roman Empire falling in 476 CE.

The legacy of Rome continues today in legal systems, languages, and modern city planning.
