Artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain.
They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, which transform inputs through weighted connections.

A neural network learns by adjusting these weights during the training process to minimize prediction error.
Common types of neural networks include feedforward networks, convolutional networks for image tasks, and recurrent networks for sequential data.

Modern deep learning systems often contain millions of parameters and require large datasets to train effectively.
